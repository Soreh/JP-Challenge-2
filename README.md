# JP-Challenge-2

 An exercice done during the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway
 It's purpose is to demonstrate the use of the 4 OOP pilars through a very simple project
 made from scratch.
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
 - Encapsulation
 - Abstraction

 The game is a 1st person shooter where the player has to find his way to evade from a futuristic maze
 - Differents types of enemies derive from an abstract Enemy class (Inheritance)
 - Each type of enemy deals different kind of damage (Polymorphism)
 - The health of the player is a Property using getters and setters to access the actual private health value (Encapsulation)
 - Code is organized in a way that reduces duplicate code through higher level methods (abstraction).

 The purpose of the exercice waas also to demonstrate the use of code versionning, in orde to do so, each functionnality (such as the main scree, the player controls, or else the building of the environment) has been coded individualy in a dedicated branch before being merge into main.
